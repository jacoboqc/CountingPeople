# Whole data mac count
```{r}

source("./static-analysis.R")
mac_data <- read_capture("./Captura_Peritos.csv")
#> names(mac_data)
## [1] "mac"    "device" "ID"     "time"   "type"  
mac_distro <- mac_count_distribution(mac_data, mac_col = "mac")
summary(mac_distro$mac_count)
```
Datta summary shows most macs appear few times, less than 80 times. Histogramm will we displayed according to this.
```{r}
q90 <- quantile(mac_distro$mac_count, probs = 0.9)
hist(filter(mac_distro, mac_count <= q90)$mac_count, xlab = "Mac appearances",
     main = "Mac count distribution")
```
# Macs per time interval. 
Both the previously seen ones and the new ones are counted
```{r}
interval_mac_count <- count_macs_interval(mac_data, "time", "mac", "1 sec")
```
